I'm a senior software engineer working at NVIDIA in Santa Clara, California. I work on the display driver as well as sensor firmware. I primarily work in C and C++.

Previously, I worked at Amazon Lab126 where I developed operating system software as well as Cisco Systems where I wrote a Linux kernel device driver for networking hardware. In my undergrad, I was in a few research labs where I developed firmware for embedded systems on telescopes as well as software for ground station communications. In my spare time, I've created software for various embedded devices ranging from sun-tracking solar panels to satellite-tracking antennae and even hardware emulation.

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Georgia Tech where I primarily studied operating systems, embedded software, and computer architecture.

## Education
- M.S. in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2020-2023
- B.S. in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2015-2018

## Interests
My primarily interest is classical guitar. I have been playing for a few years and look up to Segovia himself. Maybe one day I'll be half decent.

Outside of guitar I enjoy doing volunteer work. I have volunteered with Habitat for Humanity in Atlanta and Austin Parks Foundation in Austin, Texas. I got into carpet weaving a while back and have been hooked ever since. Creating intricate design patterns from just a loom is surprisingly very rewarding.

Like most living in the Bay Area, I fell in love with the great outdoors and became an avid hiker (fun fact: I've hiked to the top of Half Dome in Yosemite :D). My goal is to one day hike a good part of the Appalachian Trail!

Hope to see you on my journey!
