I'm an embedded software engineer working at Amazon Lab126 in Austin, Texas. I work on operating system software as well as device firmware. I primarily work in C++, but I have extensive experience developing C software, and I'm actively developing open source software in Rust.

Previously, I worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory writing C++ space flight simulation software as well as Cisco Systems where I wrote a Linux kernel device driver for networking hardware. In my undergrad, I was in a few research labs where I developed firmware for embedded systems on telescopes as well as software for ground station communications. In my spare time, I've created software for various embedded devices ranging from sun-tracking solar panels to satellite-tracking antennae and even hardware emulation.

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Georgia Tech where I primarily studied operating systems, embedded software, and computer architecture.

## Education
- M.S. in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2020-2023
- B.S. in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2015-2018

## Interests
Outside of work I enjoy doing volunteer work. I have volunteered with Habitat for Humanity in Atlanta and Austin Parks Foundation here in Austin. I got into carpet weaving a while back and have been hooked ever since. Creating intricate design patterns from just a loom is surprisingly very rewarding.

I've been playing clarinet for the better part of 10 years and guitar for about five. Recently I've begun taking up classical guitar. Hopefully I'll have footage of me playing at a recital soon! Like most living in the Bay Area, I fell in love with the great outdoors and became an avid hiker (fun fact: I've hiked to the top of Half Dome in Yosemite :D). My goal is to one day hike a good part of the Appalachian Trail!

Hope to see you on my journey!
